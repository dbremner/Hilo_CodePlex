 * When you select an item to view from the browse page, it will not 
   be selected in the image view page. Once you select a picture
   from the film strip at the top, it will be selected and start 
   working

 * When navigating back after saving a crop or rotate image action, 
   it does not orient to the cropped or rotated image.

 * Loading the initial set of photos may be slow as we turned off 
   usage of the indexer when executing the photo query.  This is
   due to inconstistent caching of photo indexes on some machines
   particularly when photos were deleted.
