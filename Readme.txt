* The main hub page will sometimes not show the items in the grid 
  view. You can click anywhere on below the Hilo text and the 
  navigation will occur correctly. When you navigate back, normally
  you will see the pictures.
  
 * When you select an item to view from the browse page, it will not 
   be selected in the image view page. Once you select a picture
   from the film strip at the top, it will be selected and start 
   working
   
 * Once you edit an image (rotate or crop), when saving the image,
   a zero byte file is created. Useful, no, interesting, yes. This 
   might cause the application to crash if you select it in the
   image browser.
